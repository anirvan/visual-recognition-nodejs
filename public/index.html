<h1>IBM Watson Visual Recognition Demo</h1>

<p>Unfortunately the demo is currently overloading it's server and has been taken offline for the moment.</p>

<p>However, you can <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html">learn more about the visual recognition service</a>,
  and the code is <a href="https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/visual-recognition-nodejs">available on GitHub</a>
  if you'd like to spin up a local copy of the demo. (Note: this requires service credentials, instructions are in the readme.)</p>
